Comprehensive Equipment & Inventory Tracker for a Muslim Community Basketball League

AMAinventory is a streamlined inventory management tool designed specifically for Muslim community basketball leagues. It helps organizers, coaches, and volunteers keep track of all essential league equipment—jerseys, balls, scoreboards, first-aid kits, training gear, and more—in a clean, organized, and reliable system.

Built with the needs and values of a Muslim league in mind, AMAinventory supports structured organization, accountability, and smooth operation before, during, and after every game night. Whether managing a youth division, adult brothers’ league, sisters’ league, or mixed community programs, this system ensures every item is accounted for and ready for use.

It’s practical, easy to use, and designed to help your league stay focused on what truly matters—community, teamwork, and excellence on and off the court.
